## JBG050 Data Challenge 2

### âœ… TODO
- [ ] Look what is the total percentage of crimes that have CR as their outcome? 
- [ ] LOok how these CRs are distributed across crime types? i.e, what is the percentage of CR across each crime type and what is the percentage of each crime type in all the crimes resulted in CR?
- [ ] Decision tree of resulting into CR? -> What does the tree look like? Anything notable? If so, how confident are we in terms of bias and variance and also entropy?
